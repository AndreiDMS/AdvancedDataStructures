# Advanced Data Structures

## Binary Search Trees (BST)
Sometimes called ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of containers: data structures that store *items* (such as numbers, names etc.) in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of items.

### Methods
| Method | Example | 
| ------ | ------- | 
| insert | `bst.insert(new Bst.Node(1));` |
| search | `bst.search(5);` |
| delete | `bst.delete(bst.search(5));` |
| successor | `bst.successor(bst.search(5));` |
| predecessor | `bst.predecessor(bst.search(5))` |
| minimum | `bst.minimum();` |
| maximum | `bst.maximum();` |
